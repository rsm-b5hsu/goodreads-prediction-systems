Goodreads Book Review Prediction – Method Overview
================================================

RATING PREDICTION
--------------------------
Approach: Alternating Least Squares (ALS) with Latent Factors
- Global bias (alpha) + user bias (betaU) + item bias (betaI) + latent factors
- Hyperparameters (after grid search): K=10 latent dimensions for user/item embeddings' Regularization: λ_bias=2.0, λ_latent=12.0
- 50 iterations of alternating least squares optimization
- Predictions clipped to valid range [1, 5]


READ PREDICTION
------------------------
Approach: Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) with Latent Factors
- Matrix factorization optimized for implicit feedback (read/not read)
- K=10 latent dimensions for users and books
- User bias + book bias + latent factor interactions
- BPR loss: optimizes pairwise ranking (read books > unread books)
- Hyperparameters: lr=0.08, reg=0.01, 20 iterations, 20k samples/iteration
- Threshold calibrated on training data (45th percentile)
- Popularity boost for cold-start items


CATEGORY PREDICTION
----------------------------
Approach: TF-IDF with N-grams for Genre Classification

Feature Engineering (Following Text Mining Best Practices):
- TF-IDF vectorization: Downweights common words, upweights distinctive terms
- Unigrams + Bigrams (ngram_range=1,2): Captures genre-specific phrases
  (e.g., "graphic novel", "science fiction", "young adult")
- 2500 features: Balances coverage and computational efficiency
- Stopword removal: Filters non-discriminative words ("the", "and", "of")
- Frequency filtering:
  * min_df=2: Removes typos and extremely rare terms
  * max_df=0.95: Filters overly common words across all genres
- Text preprocessing: Lowercase, unicode normalization, alphabetic tokens only
